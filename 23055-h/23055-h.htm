      THE SLANDERER

    </p>
    <p>
      Sergey Kapitonlch Akhineyev, the teacher of calligraphy, gave his daughter
      Natalya in marriage to the teacher of history and geography, Ivan
      Petrovich Loshadinikh. The wedding feast went on swimmingly. They sang,
      played, and danced in the parlor. Waiters, hired for the occasion from the
      club, bustled about hither and thither like madmen, in black frock coats
      and soiled white neckties. A loud noise of voices smote the air. From the
      outside people looked in at the windows;&mdash;their social standing gave
      them no right to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at midnight the host, Akhineyev, made his way to the kitchen to see
      whether everything was ready for the supper. The kitchen was filled with
      smoke from the floor to the ceiling; the smoke reeked with the odors of
      geese, ducks, and many other things. Victuals and beverages were scattered
      about on two tables in artistic disorder. Marfa, the cook, a stout,
      red-faced woman, was busying herself near the loaded tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me the sturgeon, dear,&rdquo; said Akhineyev, rubbing his hands and
      licking his lips. &ldquo;What a fine odor! I could just devour the whole
      kitchen! Well, let me see the sturgeon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marfa walked up to one of the benches and carefully lifted a greasy
      newspaper. Beneath that paper, in a huge dish, lay a big fat sturgeon,
      amid capers, olives, and carrots. Akhineyev glanced at the sturgeon and
      heaved a sigh of relief. His face became radiant, his eyes rolled. He bent
      down, and, smacking his lips, gave vent to a sound like a creaking wheel.
      He stood a while, then snapped his fingers for pleasure, and smacked his
      lips once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! The sound of a hearty kiss. Whom have you been kissing there,
      Marfusha?&rdquo; some one&rsquo;s voice was heard from the adjoining room, and soon
      the closely cropped head of Vankin, the assistant school instructor,
      appeared in the doorway. &ldquo;Whom have you been kissing here? A-a-ah! Very
      good! Sergey Kapitonich! A fine old man indeed! With the female sex
      tête-à-tête!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t kissing at all,&rdquo; said Akhineyev, confused; &ldquo;who told you, you
      fool? I only&mdash;smacked my lips on account of&mdash;in consideration of
      my pleasure&mdash;at the sight of the fish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell that to some one else, not to me!&rdquo; exclaimed Vankin, whose face
      expanded into a broad smile as he disappeared behind the door. Akhineyev
      blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil knows what may be the outcome of this!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll go
      about tale-bearing now, the rascal. He&rsquo;ll disgrace me before the whole
      town, the brute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Akhineyev entered the parlor timidly and cast furtive glances to see what
      Vankin was doing. Vankin stood near the piano and, deftly bending down,
      whispered something to the inspector&rsquo;s sister-in-law, who was laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about me!&rdquo; thought Akhineyev. &ldquo;About me, the devil take him! She
      believes him, she&rsquo;s laughing. My God! No, that mustn&rsquo;t be left like that.
      No. I&rsquo;ll have to fix it so that no one shall believe him. I&rsquo;ll speak to
      all of them, and he&rsquo;ll remain a foolish gossip in the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Akhineyev scratched his head, and, still confused, walked up to Padekoi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in the kitchen a little while ago, arranging things there for the
      supper,&rdquo; he said to the Frenchman. &ldquo;You like fish, I know, and I have a
      sturgeon just so big. About two yards. Ha, ha, ha! Yes, by the way, I have
      almost forgotten. There was a real anecdote about that sturgeon in the
      kitchen. I entered the kitchen a little while ago and wanted to examine
      the food. I glanced at the sturgeon and for pleasure, I smacked my lips&mdash;it
      was so piquant! And just at that moment the fool Vankin entered and says&mdash;ha,
      ha, ha&mdash;and says: &lsquo;A-a! A-a-ah! You have been kissing here?&rsquo;&mdash;with
      Marfa; just think of it&mdash;with the cook! What a piece of invention,
      that blockhead. The woman is ugly, she looks like a monkey, and he says we
      were kissing. What a queer fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a queer fellow?&rdquo; asked Tarantulov, as he approached them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refer to Vankin. I went out into the kitchen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The story of Marfa and the sturgeon was repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes me laugh. What a queer fellow he is. In my opinion it is more
      pleasant to kiss the dog than to kiss Marfa,&rdquo; added Akhineyev, and,
      turning around, he noticed Mzda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been speaking about Vankin,&rdquo; he said to him. &ldquo;What a queer
      fellow. He entered the kitchen and noticed me standing beside Marfa, and
      immediately he began to invent different stories. &lsquo;What?&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;you
      have been kissing each other!&rsquo; He was drunk, so he must have been
      dreaming. And I,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I would rather kiss a duck than kiss Marfa. And
      I have a wife,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you fool.&rsquo; He made me appear ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who made you appear ridiculous?&rdquo; inquired the teacher of religion,
      addressing Akhineyev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vankin. I was standing in the kitchen, you know, and looking at the
      sturgeon&mdash;&rdquo; And so forth. In about half an hour all the guests knew
      the story about Vankin and the sturgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let him tell,&rdquo; thought Akhineyev, rubbing his hands. &ldquo;Let him do it.
      He&rsquo;ll start to tell them, and they&rsquo;ll cut him short: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,
      you fool! We know all about it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Akhineyev felt so much appeased that, for joy, he drank four glasses
      of brandy over and above his fill. Having escorted his daughter to her
      room, he went to his own and soon slept the sleep of an innocent child,
      and on the following day he no longer remembered the story of the
      sturgeon. But, alas! Man proposes and God disposes. The evil tongue does
      its wicked work, and even Akhineyev&rsquo;s cunning did not do him any good. One
      week later, on a Wednesday, after the third lesson, when Akhineyev stood
      in the teachers&rsquo; room and discussed the vicious inclinations of the pupil
      Visyekin, the director approached him, and, beckoning to him, called him
      aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Sergey Kapitonich,&rdquo; said the director. &ldquo;Pardon me. It isn&rsquo;t my
      affair, yet I must make it clear to you, nevertheless. It is my duty&mdash;You
      see, rumors are on foot that you are on intimate terms with that woman&mdash;with
      your cook&mdash;It isn&rsquo;t my affair, but&mdash;You may be on intimate terms
      with her, you may kiss her&mdash;You may do whatever you like, but,
      please, don&rsquo;t do it so openly! I beg of you. Don&rsquo;t forget that you are a
      pedagogue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Akhineyev stood as though frozen and petrified. Like one stung by a swarm
      of bees and scalded with boiling water, he went home. On his way it seemed
      to him as though the whole town stared at him as at one besmeared with tar&mdash;At
      home new troubles awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you eat anything?&rdquo; asked his wife at their dinner. &ldquo;What are
      you thinking about? Are you thinking about Cupid, eh? You are longing for
      Marfushka. I know everything already, you Mahomet. Kind people have opened
      my eyes, you barbarian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she slapped him on the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from the table, and staggering, without cap or coat, directed his
      footsteps toward Vankin. The latter was at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You rascal!&rdquo; he said to Vankin. &ldquo;Why have you covered me with mud before
      the whole world? Why have you slandered me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How; what slander? What are you inventing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who told everybody that I was kissing Marfa? Not you, perhaps? Not
      you, you murderer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vankin began to blink his eyes, and all the fibres of his face began to
      quiver. He lifted his eyes toward the image and ejaculated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God punish me, may I lose my eyesight and die, if I said even a
      single word about you to any one! May I have neither house nor home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vankin&rsquo;s sincerity admitted of no doubt. It was evident that it was not he
      who had gossiped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who was it? Who?&rdquo; Akhineyev asked himself, going over in his mind all
      his acquaintances, and striking his chest. &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;
